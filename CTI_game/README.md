## **How to Play**

1. **Start the Game**:
   - The game will present an ASCII banner with the title "CHECK THE INTEL * STOP THE ATTACK!".
   - You'll choose between two game modes: identifying **Software** or **Threat Groups**.

2. **Objective**:
   - For each round, you will be given a description and four options: one correct answer and three incorrect options.
   - Your goal is to select the correct option, which could either be a hacker group or software.

3. **Lives and End of the Game**:
   - You start with 3 lives.
   - If you select the wrong answer, you lose a life. If you lose all your lives, the game ends with an ASCII "YOU'VE BEEN PWND" message.

4. **Post-Game Options**:
   - After losing all your lives, you can choose to restart the game or exit.
